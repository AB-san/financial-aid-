I am writing to apply for financial aid for the course 'Introduction to Git and GitHub' on Coursera. My name is Ansuman Behera and I am a Btech CSE 3rd year student at XYZ University.

I am very interested in taking this course because I believe it will be valuable for my professional development as a computer science student. Git and GitHub are essential tools for any developer, and having a strong understanding of how they work is crucial for working on software projects. This course looks like an excellent opportunity to learn about Git and GitHub and how to use them effectively.

Unfortunately, I am unable to pay for the course on my own. As a student, my financial resources are limited and I cannot afford the full cost of the course. I am hopeful that with financial aid, I will be able to take this course and further my education in a subject that I am passionate about.

I understand that financial aid is often need-based, and I want to assure you that I am in need of assistance to be able to take this course. I believe that with the knowledge and skills I will gain from this course, I will be able to improve my chances of success in my studies and in my future career.

Thank you for considering my application for financial aid. I hope to hear from you soon.

Sincerely,
Ansuman Behera
